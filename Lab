        int x=sc.nextInt();
        System.out.println("Enter y");
        int y=sc.nextInt();
        System.out.println("Enter z");
        int z=sc.nextInt();
        if(x<=y&&x<=z)
        System.out.printf("L1 has the minimal seating capacity");
        else if(y<=x&&y<=z)
        System.out.printf("L2 has the minimal seating capacity");
        else
        System.out.printf("L3 has the minimal seating capacity");
    }
}
