The first integer corresponds to the last 2 digits of the birth year. 

The second integer corresponds to the last 2 digits of the current year.

Output Format:

Refer sample input and output for further formatting specifications.

[All text in bold corresponds to input and the rest corresponds to output]

import java.util.*;
public class Agedetect
{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Enter Year of Birth");
        int a=sc.nextInt();
        System.out.println("Enter Current year");
        int b=sc.nextInt();
        if(b<a)
        {
            System.out.printf("Your age is %d",(100-a)+b);
        }
        else
        {
            System.out.printf("Your age is %d",b-a);
        }
    }
}
